Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, and early diagnosis is essential for improving patient outcomes. This project aims to explore a heart disease dataset and provide insights into the factors that may contribute to the development of heart disease.

The project uses Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.

Data Source
The data used in this project was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 14 attributes and 303 samples, with the target variable being the presence of heart disease.

Installation and Usage
To use this project, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website, and Jupyter Notebook can be installed using the following command:

Copy code
pip install jupyter
You can then clone the repository and open the Data_visualization_final.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook to run the code and explore the data visualization.

Features
The project provides various data visualizations to explore the relationships between different variables and their impact on the presence of heart disease. The visualizations include:

Correlation Matrix Heatmap
Bar Plot of Age Distribution
Box Plots of Continuous Variables
Violin Plots of Continuous Variables by Heart Disease Presence
Count Plots of Categorical Variables by Heart Disease Presence
Scatter Plots of Continuous Variables by Heart Disease Presence
Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! You can contribute by:

Adding new visualizations to explore the dataset further
Refactoring code to improve performance or readability
Fixing any bugs or errors that may be present
